# [Anti Team Griefing]
## About
This plugin was designed to combat players possibility of ruining the game for their teammates through a various of actions related to team attacking. The goal is to reduce the amount of impact that a ruinous invidiual can have at the overall gameplay for their teammates.
With this plugin installed on your server you can disable the slow-down effect that occurs when attacking a teammate, as well as removing the head shaking that happens when a teammate headshots you, and also replace the loud 'dinging' headshot sound, with the normal sound that is played when being team-attacked.


## Additional Information
This plugin compliments the [Team Damage Modifier](https://github.com/ManifestManah/Team-Damage-Modifier) plugin that I created together with SanjayS very well. If you would like your server to have a FaceIt-like damage structure, then I can highly recommend checking it out.
